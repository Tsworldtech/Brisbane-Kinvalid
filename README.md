## Optimizations

State Management with Zustand: Centralized and cached data like products, navbar, footer, and page content to prevent unnecessary API calls and improve browsing performance.



Supabase Integration with Error Handling: Structured API calls with robust error handling for reliability and graceful fallbacks.

Modular & Maintainable Code: Each data type has its own fetch function, keeping logic clean and easy to maintain.

Performance-Optimized Components: Navbar and footer render dynamically from cached data, reducing DOM updates and repetitive re-renders.

Accessibility & UX: Semantic HTML, clear focus states, and accessible interactive elements for better usability.
